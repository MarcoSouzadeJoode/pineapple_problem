A simulator of the "Pineapple" problem from IWAA 2024.

Problem statement:

Consider a desert planet with radius R = 6 000 km whose equatorial plane has zero inclination relative to its orbital plane
and whose synodic rotation period (solar day) is P = 24 hours. Starting at a latitude φ (where 0◦ < φ < 90◦), Marco
decided to set out on a tour of his life: every morning, he wakes up at sunrise and starts walking at constant speed
v = 5 km/h. He continuously changes his direction so that he always follows the azimuth of the Sun. At sunset he goes to
sleep. And then he repeats, every day. Find the change of φ in Marco’s latitude per one solar day as a function of φ. Can
he make it to the equator in finite time?

This simulator allows to explore the entire parameter space, i.e., different speeds, axial tilts, etc., witout the necessity for simple analytical models.
